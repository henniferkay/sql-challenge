# sql-challenge

## Background
The main aim of this project was to explore data modeling, engineering and analysis in SQL using employee data from the 1980s-1990s of a fictional company.

## Methods
The employee database schema was first illustrated as an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). After creating six tables with specific columns to match their respective CSV files, the employee data were imported into a SQL database, ready for analysis. Information about the employees' identification, departments they were associated with, and salaries was retreived by selecting certain columns and filtering out different conditions. Two SQL programs were written to create the schema tables and query the data.
